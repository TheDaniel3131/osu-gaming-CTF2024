I have been playing osu! way before I started my CTF journey. It was back in 2018 and I had a lot of fun memories in osu!. 
Unfortunately, I did not enjoy playing osu! like I used to so I play less than before.. do not get me wrong, I still play osu! but I mostly play because I want to have fun and chill.

To be honest, this CTF tournament.. I actually do not/never expect CTF and osu! will have a crossover that SOON. And here we are.. lol

I did pretty well considering I was solo-ing and as a representative for my CTF Team - @myst3r10us. Did not manage to finish some but after the tournament ended, I looked up to the writeups of others and learned a lot as well.
We will back stronger next time!
